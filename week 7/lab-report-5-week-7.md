# Lab Report 5 Week 7

## Part 1
Here is the vim keys I used to change the name of the "start" parameter to be used by "base" instead.

    vim DocSearchServer.java
    <Enter>
    /start
    <Enter>
    dw
    i
    Base
    <Esc>
    /start
    <Enter>
    dw
    i
    Base
    <Esc>
    /start
    <Enter>
    dw
    i
    Base
    <Esc>
    :wq

## Part 2

When manually editing my file, it took me 3:27 minutes to finish the task, while it took me 5:49 minutes to do it on vim. The reason it took me longer to edit it on vim was just cause I am not used to using vim, so I kept accidentally pressing the wrong keys.

- I would prefer using the first style when running on a remote server, partly because I am more familiar with it, but mostly because I type faster on Visual Studio code.
- The factor that would help me decide which style to run would be how many edits I would have to make. If I had to make a few edits, then I would use vim, but if I had to rewrite entire lines of code, I would manually code.
